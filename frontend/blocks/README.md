# Additional blocks

This directory contains additional blocks to the default Arduino blocks.

The blockly fork contains only the blocks relevant to all the Arduino functionality available out of the box. Blocks for any third party libraries will be contained here.

During development, the `blocks_data.json` file has been manually created and maintained in this directory. This file combines all the data stored in each individual `blocks_config.json` file. In the future this data will be automatically generated by the `ardublocklyserver`.

The JSON format will be documented once the feature is in a more stable state.

For now the menu to add these blocks is only accessible through the Electron development environment, or executing the `Ardublockly.openExtraCategoriesSelect()` on console.


### THIS IS STILL AN EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE
